This will serve as notes thougout the project
---------------------------------------------
- Bigger picture: What type of GUI will be needed (mobile vs desktop(windows mac and linux)
    - wxPython:
        - Offers desktop support, but is more complex and better for larger projects
        - Lacks support for mobile
        - With the complexity, will add more the learning curve
    - Kivy:
        - Primaraly offers mobile support
        - Much simplier to use and learn
        - Lack of quality desktop support
    - Might look to do a survey to see which one to focus first?
        - I belive that most of the framework can be done first and I can select which I want to use at a later date
- Need to create a database that will last even with the program being closed
    - Might start with SQLite and then move over to postgresql when needed
- Will have to start looking into what functions I need in terms of infromation
- Need to look at the webscraper module, it's been a while since it's been used and I need to incoportate it soon
- Would like to have a working prototype preferable by thursday so I can send it to Aghilles for testing
  purposes, would give great information into what fucntions might be needed
    - This will exclude the GUI as it's too much to work with at this point, but that may be a much needed
      module for actual use
- Create proper documentation for this programs use until the GUI comes around?
