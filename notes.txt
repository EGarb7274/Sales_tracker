This will serve as notes thougout the project
---------------------------------------------
- Bigger picture: What type of GUI will be needed (mobile vs desktop(windows mac and linux)
    - wxPython:
        - Offers desktop support, but is more complex and better for larger projects
        - Lacks support for mobile
        - With the complexity, will add more the learning curve
    - Kivy:
        - Primaraly offers mobile support
        - Much simplier to use and learn
        - Lack of quality desktop support
    - Might look to do a survey to see which one to focus first?
        - I belive that most of the framework can be done first and I can select which I want to use at a later date
- Need to create a database that will last even with the program being closed
    - Might start with SQLite and then move over to postgresql when needed
