    - Looked into creating the database for the project
    - Learning more about SQL and how it'll work, as well as how SQLite works and the constraints of
      what it can and can't do
    - Created the database and a few basic queries that will be used
    - pip installed matplotlib
    - setting up matplotlib to be able to use the database to create graphs
12-10-2024
    - Might add a watch class, seperate from the queries class
        - Still on the fence with this one, not sure how much one would be needed
          need too look at what I doing in the API scaper to see what that returns
    - Added a graph class that will be able to output various graphs based on what the user wants
        - Only a line graph is available at the moment and I need to tweek how that works
        - Plan to add a pie chart that displays sold inventory(price) compare to unsold inventory(price)
        - Maybe a bar chart that displays weekly,monthly,yearly earnings? unsure at the moment
    - Added functionality to the queries class allowing it to be able to combine totals and return lists
      for use in other functions
